MQTTalk
=======

It's an MQTT and QT based talk app.  Well if Facebook can do it why not make a free one?

This is just for fun, I'm not suggesting you use it.

Building this source
--------------------

You need to have libqt4-dev installed and qmake, you'll also need libmosquittopp0-dev.

    cd mqttalk
    qmake
    make
