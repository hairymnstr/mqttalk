MQTTalk
=======

It's an MQTT and QT based talk app.  Well if Facebook can do it why not make a free one?

This is just for fun, I'm not suggesting you use it.

Building this source
--------------------

Requires libqt4-dev and qt4-qmake (package names from Ubuntu).
Also needs a 1.3.x version of libmosquitto, you'll need the PPA if you're using 14.04.

    cd mqttalk
    qmake
    make
